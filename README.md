This application is a password generator that will generate a random password based on requirements the user inputs. This application accepts the minimum length of the password, the minimum amount of numbers needed
and the minimum number of special characters needed. If none are provided it will set the password length to 8 and numbers/special characters required to 0.

*This application was created to improve my coding skills along with learning about how to generate strong passwords for users. This application works along side the password strength checker application that I also designed and created.*

****AS OF NOW THIS APPLICATION DOES NOT CHECK FOR STRING VALUES ENTERED (A FUTURE UPDATE)****

This application has 3 buttons, the "Special Characters", "Numbers", and "Generate Password" buttons.
- The special characters/numbers button when toggled will turn green and show that the password will make sure there are special characters and numbers in the password
- The generate password button when clicked will take all the requirements inputted by the user and generate a password in the middle of the GUI



***Future Updates***
- Adding different buttons that will automatically generate a password based on certain security recommendations without needing the user to enter in specific requirements
